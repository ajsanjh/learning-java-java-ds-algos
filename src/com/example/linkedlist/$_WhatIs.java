	 * Linked list has concept of nodes:
	 * 
	 * Node is like a single entry in this DS.
	 * Node has 2 parts called blocks:
	 * 	-- in each node first block is the container part and contains the value you want to save at that node.
	 * 	-- second block contains the address(pointer) to the next node and so no: hence 'Linked List'
	 * Also:
	 * 	-- second block of last node points to 'null' since it has nothing to point to.
	 * 	-- the first node, called head. it generally would not hold a value but just point to the next node.
	 * 
	 * Also:
	 * items can be inserted towards the head of the list or tail and no other way.
